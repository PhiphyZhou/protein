To Do(*): 

* Study with Alanine data:
  - Generate 1 micro-second span of alanine data (only got less than 1/20)
  - label alanine data using dihedral angles
  * Generate more simulation starting from rare state seeds
  * What clustering method makes more sense 
    (hierarchical using rmsd,k-means on coords, PCA...)
    - Option 1: use k-means with given initial centers
    * Option 2: GMM or membership function
  * How to label transition states from the phi-psi distribution?
    (need to use GMM or membership function?)
  * Is sequence clustering consistant with frame clustering in representing state and transition?
    
* Do classification on bpti data
  * do clustering with rmsd to generate labels on 100 files (each 40)
  * compare classification using PCA and encoder on 100 files
	
* Go parallel
  - install distributed tensorflow in container
  * write simple distributed TF for testing
  * modify code to use distributed tensorflow
  * assign nodes for training on damsl or Marcc
  * preprocessing data in parallel (randomize before learning iterations)

* Basic rnn on trajectory data for predicting the next frame 
  (adapted from Tensorflow ptb model)

* Tensorflow code polishing
  * add summary writters for Tensorboard to use

------------
Done(-):

- Set up Docker image using Dockerfile

- datareader: Preprocessed protein data from pdb and dcd files 

- Use sequence-to-sequence model to learn feature encoding 
  of a sequence of frames (adpted from Tensorflow translation model) 
  - encoder-decoder.train
    - modify for training on protein data
  - encoder-decoder.encode: 
   a new function for outputing the states of a given sequence
    - modify the output of seq2seq_model.step for forward_only==True
    - write a simpler version for only using the encoder part 
      of the model and input_feed
  - seq2seq_model.init
    - redefine loss function in seq2seq_model
    - debug using simple example to make sure the calculation is correct
    - rewrite model_with_buckets using a different loss function
  - Use high-dim self-test data to test new loss function
  - seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq: used to define seq2seq_f()
    No need. Can use seq2seq.basic_rnn_seq2seq
  - seq2seq.model_with_buckets: rewrote it as a new 
    model_with_buckets within seq2seq_model.
  - encoder-decoder.create_model
  - seq2seq_model.get_batch
  - seq2seq_model.step
  - reverse the order of decoder_inputs
  - print out the encoded states
  - compute a single reconstruction error (not for batches)

- Do clustering on trajectory and label each frame  
  - clustering directly on coordinates
  - clustering on rmsd using distance matrix
  - add PCA to k-means clustering method
Note: rmsd clustering works much more consistant with classification
      than coordinate clustering. 

- Test classification on the learned features.(finish major code)
 do it on alanine data and compare to rmsd clustering result
  - modify datareader to read the alanine data
  - deal with data in water with topology.selection function 
  - generate alanine simulation data (using NAMD)
  - Figure out the error of installing OpenMM using Dockerfile 
    (abandoned OpenMM because of nan error in integration)
  - classify using coordinates
  - classify using PCA
  - classify using RNN encoded states
  - nan problem with the training 
    (It's related to sliding out of data range)
  - generate more alanine data(10000) ---waiting Marcc job id:5522858
    The label is too unbalanced, do it again. Submitted batch job 5626764
  - cluster the alanine-10000 data with sequence variance
  - classify sequences (including trasitions) instead of frames
    (anyway to distinguish transition states? - using variance)
  - Repeat Ben's method of clustering
