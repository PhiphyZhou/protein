-------------
To Do: 
- Basic rnn on trajectory data for predicting the next frame (adapted from Tensorflow ptb model)
- Use sequence-to-sequence model to learn feature of a singel frame (adpted from Tensorflow translation model) 

------------
Done:
- Set up Docker image using Dockerfile
- Preprocessed protein data from pdb files, including window smoothing and batch partition
