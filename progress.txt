-------------
To Do(*): 
* Basic rnn on trajectory data for predicting the next frame (adapted from Tensorflow ptb model)
* Use sequence-to-sequence model to learn feature of a singel frame (adpted from Tensorflow translation model) 
    * encoder-decoder.train
      line 145. Need to redefine loss function in seq2seq_model
    - encoder-decoder.create_model
    - seq2seq_model.get_batch
    * seq2seq_model.step
------------
Done(-):
- Set up Docker image using Dockerfile
- datareader: Preprocessed protein data from pdb files, including window smoothing and batch partition
