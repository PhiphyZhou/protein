-------------
To Do(*): 
* Basic rnn on trajectory data for predicting the next frame (adapted from Tensorflow ptb model)
* Use sequence-to-sequence model to learn feature of a singel frame (adpted from Tensorflow translation model) 
    * encoder-decoder.train: done before line 145
    * seq2seq_model.init
      * redefine loss function in seq2seq_model
      * rewrite model_with_buckets using a different loss function
      * Use high-dim self-test data to test new loss function 
    - seq2seq.embedding_attention_seq2seq: used to define seq2seq_f()
      No need. Can use seq2seq.basic_rnn_seq2seq
    * seq2seq.model_with_buckets: training model, loss function goes into here
    - encoder-decoder.create_model
    - seq2seq_model.get_batch
    - seq2seq_model.step
------------
Done(-):
- Set up Docker image using Dockerfile
- datareader: Preprocessed protein data from pdb files, including window smoothing and batch partition
